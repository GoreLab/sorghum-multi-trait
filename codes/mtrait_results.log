I've inserted something that you may have forgotten.
(See the <inserted text> above.)

        Prediction:
Sorry, but I'm not programmed to handle this case;
I'll just pretend that you didn't ask for it.
If you're in the wrong mode, you might be able to
return to the right one by typing `I}' or `I$' or `I\par'.
